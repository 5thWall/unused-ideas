Albumcolors.js
==============

Pulls colors from an image to create a color palate. Inspired by the iTunes album view. Detects contrast and substitutes white/black for colors that don't work. Can do additional analysis to try to select colors that most closely match complementary or analogous or triad schemes.

Look into Bridsonâ€™s algorithm for Poisson-disc sampling for creating initial samples.
