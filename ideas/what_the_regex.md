# What The Regex

What The Regex is a(n) (choose: library|app|webapp) that uses a genetic algorithm to find strings that match a given regex.

Or maybe it does the opposite, given a list of strings to match creates a regex which would match all of them. That sounds cool, though need to take care that it biases towards general solutions rather than hard-coding each example.
