BitTorent Sync Podcasts
=======================

Use the power of [BitTorent Sync][btsync] for podcast distribution.
This is an idea for a client application which will download and manage
podcasts using a BTSync backend. Like other podcast catchers, it will
read in an RSS feed for podcasts but will understand and expect URLs
formatted like `btsync://[secret]/path/to/file.mp3` where `[secret]` is
a BTSync secret.

Suggested Technologies
----------------------

* Bittorent Sync (duh)
* Node-Webkit (because I really do eventually need to make an app powered by this)
 * Angular JS (again, really need to make an app powered by Angular)
